## Dockerized Node.js Kafka integration

A simple money transfer example app, using Docker, Node and Kafka.

The app allows 3 actions: Deposit, withdraw and transfer.


Some notes:

- Currency exchange will be done on every action.
- We're going to use the ISO 4217.
- All the actions are sent to Kafka to be processed.
